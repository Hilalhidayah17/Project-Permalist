# Project-Permalist
This is a project from my learning about the CRUD system using mySql.
PermaList is a simple to-do list web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks on their to-do list. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently.
